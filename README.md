# Evil Chat Tutorial

Just playing through some online Rails 5.1.x tutorials. 
Simple, somewhat new-ish methodologies for creating sensible frontends. 
All without the need of crazy JS libs/frameworks. 

The modularity here is great and if anything, 
I am learning some tricks when it comes to BEM 
and better CSS management.
